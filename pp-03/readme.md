1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

- Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14a0u0klzcogCvgk3L9IIJC6D0R
- Your Rationale: I think the different shades of purple would go well with the idea of gaming in general. Xbox is rocking the green colors and the Playstation has the iconic blue. Purple would be great for a website that is introducing a new console. The different shades of the purple could be a good representations of the different genres of gaming on the console; Action, adventure, etc.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

- Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32D0z0ks5x28LZr1wj0VIRfsVi+
- Your Rationale: I believe that what attracts kids the most are bright colors. That's what I did here.
I feel like the combinations of these bright colors would grab the attentions of the kids and the more they are interested in
something the easier it will be for them to learn. Bright tends to represent fun. And that is the best way to teach kids,
by showing them something fun.

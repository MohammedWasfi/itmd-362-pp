# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/authentication/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: First thing I tried to delay the authentication as much as possible. So the first thing the user is able to look at is the different options they could choose from then after they choose where they want to go/do they get to the authentication page if required. In here I decided to implement a Touch Id verification instead of a username and password (assuming they have entered it once before).

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/bars/navigation-bars/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I added a navigation bar with the basic back and search buttons and an extra button depending on the activity of the user that stays there throughout the user's browsing but while they scroll it temporarily disappears so it doesn't bother the user. It makes it so much easier to interact with the pages and creates a user friendly navigation from one page to the other.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/user-interaction/feedback/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: My favorite feature that I added is feedback. Personally, I feel like giving feedback to the user is one of the most important features to have in anything. In here I implemented it depending on the activity the user is doing, so basically to give back some sort of conformation that everything went through and has been updated. For example, when you login or when you send an email or when you add an email, etc.
